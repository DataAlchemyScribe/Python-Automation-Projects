Welcome to the Python Automation Projects repository! ðŸš€

This repository hosts two Python projects tailored to simplify your daily tasks:

**1. YouTube Video Downloader (MP4 Format) ðŸ“¼**:
	Download your favorite YouTube videos effortlessly! Our YouTube Video Downloader now saves videos exclusively in MP4 format. Just provide the video URL, and let Python handle the rest.
 
**2. Website Automator (Smart Bookmarks) ðŸ“‘**:
	Say goodbye to scattered bookmarks! Our Website Automator acts like a smart bookmarks list. Organize webpages under specific keyword-names, and with a single command, open all associated pages instantly. Itâ€™s a time-saving hack that ensures you never forget which webpages are essential for each task.

 **3. File Backup Automator (Daily Backups) ðŸ“‚**:
 	This project ensures the safety and continuity of your work by automatically backing up critical files every day. Whether youâ€™re a developer, designer, or content creator, our Python script has you covered. Simply configure the directories you want to safeguard, and let the automation handle the rest.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and enhance these projects. Happy automating! ðŸ¤–
