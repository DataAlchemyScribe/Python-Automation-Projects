# Python-Automation-Projects
Welcome to the Python Automation Projects repository! ðŸš€

This repository hosts two Python projects tailored to simplify your daily tasks:

**1. YouTube Video Downloader (MP4 Format) ðŸ“¼**:
	Download your favorite YouTube videos effortlessly! Our YouTube Video Downloader now saves videos exclusively in MP4 format. Just provide the video URL, and let Python handle the rest.
 
**2. Website Automator (Smart Bookmarks) ðŸ“‘**:
	Say goodbye to scattered bookmarks! Our Website Automator acts like a smart bookmarks list. Organize webpages under specific keyword-names, and with a single command, open all associated pages instantly. Itâ€™s a time-saving hack that ensures you never forget which webpages are essential for each task.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and enhance these projects. Happy automating! ðŸ¤–
